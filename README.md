# Ad Hoc Record Player

My personal music collection, now in a digital flavour.

## To Do

- Generate splatter effect for records
- Add `h-card` to link
- Create main header image
- Consider microformats feed
- Scrobble button
- Display other albums by an artist on the artist page
- Record needle (?)
- Desired page
- Create CD image
- Add iconography for other tags (next to button?)
- 404 page
- Loading page
- Image optimisations
- Pagination for home page
- Lazy loading
- Sort by artist
- Sort by switches (artist or date purchased)
- Highlight most recent somehow
  - Could use a combination of `grid-column: span 2` to make them visually larger and then `grid-auto-flow: dense` to fill the gaps
  - Or leave the gaps and work out some way to fill them, maybe with music notes?
- Auto colour contrast record colours

## Future

- Discogs integration
- Spotify integration
- Last.fm integration (full)
